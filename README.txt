This is our prototype for our interface for the coolest bookmark manager ever :D
NOTE: This project requires Python 2.7 or later, which is standard on most machines

To run our interface with a sample bookmark hierarchy, go to Classes/Manager and run 'python main.py demo_scenario'
You'll now see our interface with our example scenario loaded in to the bookmarks! Feel free to play around
with the interface options available.

To easily create your own bookmark hierarchy that you'd like to test, run 'python scenario.py'
From there, you can create a hierarchy of bookmarks as if you were traversing a filesystem.
If you need help, try 'help'.
Once you've created your bookmark scenario, run it with the interface using 'python main.py <my scenario file>'

And that's it!

Best,
The Novelmarks Team
